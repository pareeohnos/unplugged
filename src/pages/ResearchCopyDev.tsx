                                In The Anxious Generation, social psychologist
                                Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the
                                epidemic of teen mental illness that has hit
                                many countries at the same time. He then
                                investigates the nature of childhood, including
                                why children need play and independent
                                exploration to mature into competent, thriving
                                adults. Haidt shows how the â€œplay-based
                                childhood" began to decline in the 1980s, and
                                how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of
                                the "phone-based childhood" in the early 2010s.
